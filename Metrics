We know that for 8-bit ASCII, each character is composed of 8 bits. 
However, this is not the most efficient way to represent letters in English language since all letters are represented
using the same number of bits regardless of how common they are (a more optimal scheme would be to use less bits for more common letters). 
Thus, we should expect that the character-level entropy of English language to be less than 8.
